         <h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
         <div>
            <p>My name is Dominic Najjar, and I am a senior at Oakland University. I was born in Royal Oak, Michigan, although I didn’t have a traditional upbringing. My family moved every five years due to my father’s career. While it was challenging, it taught me a lot of valuable skills, such as adapting to new environments, meeting people from different cultures, and trying local, authentic cuisine. I have lived in Michigan, Arizona, Canada, and Florida, but after each move, I always end up back in Michigan, which I consider home.</p>
            <p>My professional career has followed a path as diverse as my life. I've worked as everything from a construction worker to a mortgage banker, and almost everything in between. Currently, while completing my studies, I work as a real estate agent, constantly balancing the demands of my education and career.</p>
            <br>
